# Sticky‑Note App

A tiny, sticky‑note‑style notes app that lives entirely in the browser.  
Add, edit, and delete notes – everything is saved in `localStorage`, so your data sticks around after a reload.

**Built with** HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

## How to run
1. Clone the repo (or download the files).  
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser – no build step needed.

## What you can do
- Click **“+ Create Notes”** to create a note.  
- Type away – changes are saved automatically.  
- Hover a note to see the delete (🗑) button.
